            Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Never let anyone know what you are thinking. Vito, how do you like my
            little
            angel? Isn't she beautiful? The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. I am sorry.
            What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his
            thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go
            from
            here.
        </p>

        <p>
            Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. I want
            your
            answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now
            on,
            you deal with Turnbull. Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? Michael, you
            never
            told me you knew Johnny Fontane! Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take
            sides
            with anyone against the Family again. Ever.
